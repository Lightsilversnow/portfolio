            <p>We did an ideation session with the whole group to get the creative and new ideas going. We did the ideation session about how to get the knowledge of a new survey to the healthcare worker. We were planning to do more ideations sessions after we had more knowledge about the surveys and what we could adjust with it.</p>

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>We started with a everyone writing three ideas on the whiteboard. Then everyone could write down any ideas that were popping in your mind. This resulted in a lot of creative and fun ideas. Not all ideas are feasible and doable, so we digitalised our whiteboard on a Miro board and we colour coded our ideas. The green were feasible and more 'normal' ideas, the blue were fun ideas and the ligth yellow were ideas that weren't really feasible. </p>

              <h2>Storyboard</h2>
              <p>We then decided to make storyboard out of certain ideas. I chose to make a storyboard about the posters. The healthcare worker gets into work, sees a poster about the application and a new survey. He goes to the website, makes an account and can see the new survey as well as see what his stats from the previous surveys were. He also likes that he can use the live chat function to ask any questions.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>By having done the ideation session and storyboard with the whole group we bonded more and got our ideas on paper instead of in our head. This also enabled our creative juices to get flowing more and to think outside the box. This way we are more open minded about our potential ideas. </p>
