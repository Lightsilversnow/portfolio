                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>For the learning outcome goal-oriented interaction we had an international week where people from Toronto, Canada
                    came to visit for three days. The people from Toronto were divided by our groups. We got Keira
                    added to our group. She is a Chinese girl who is studying in Toronto.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>We saw a lot of different thing. Topics that seemed to be recurring during the DDW a lot were the
                    future and sustainability. I found this really interesting to see how people think about the future and
                    how we can solve the current problems that weâ€™re facing. I also found the sustainability really
                    important, since I myself like to be as sustainable as I can be whilst living comfortably. It was also
                    really nice to meet Keira and to learn a bit more about Canada and China. </p>
