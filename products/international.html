                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>We saw a lot of different thing. Topics that seemed to be recurring during the DDW a lot were the
                    future and sustainability. I found this really interesting to see how people think about the future and
                    how we can solve the current problems that weâ€™re facing. I also found the sustainability really
                    important, since I myself like to be as sustainable as I can be whilst living comfortably. It was also
                    really nice to meet Keira and to learn a bit more about Canada and China. </p>
