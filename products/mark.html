            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Dennis asked us (Robin & Tessa) for a meeting with Mark Klerkx, so we could update him of the state
                of the project. Mark is the head of the Lectorate Interaction Design, and thus runs the project in
                name of the lectorate.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Mark was pretty impressed by what we've done and encouraged us to continue in the way we had
                    been going. He said to look into different forms of nurses and to make personas from them. He also
                    thinks that it's a good idea to present the project to the consortium to show the other interested
                    parties from the project what we've done.</p>
