                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>We're going to test 6 different versions of the progress tracker, a heart, an IV bag, a plant that
                    grows, just a percentage without an icon, a horizontal progress bar and a round progress bar that
                    fills in a counterclockwise direction. We're also going to test 3 different versions of the reward
                    system, a badge collecting, a card collecting and trading and a plant collecting reward system. With
                    the plant reward we also have two different versions of how the garden would look like.</p>
