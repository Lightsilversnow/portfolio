                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>For the research questions ‘What are ways that we can make the program more engaging to fill in?’
                    and ‘What are ways that we can make the program more appealing to fill in?’ We (Robin and Tessa)
                    made a paper prototype after an ideation session. We wanted to test the different reward ideas we
                    had and the different UI survey boxes we had.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Since we only could do the test with one person, we don't have a very strong conclusion. We did
                    however still get some good insights into what we can improve, and we will show this document to
                    the rest of the team so that these ideas can be looked into and implemented.</p>
