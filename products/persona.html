          <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Robin and I wanted to make personas and user journeys following these personas. We wanted to first make the personas and user journeys with the knowledge that we already had about healthcare in general. We were then going to adjust the personas and user journeys as we got more information during the testing fases.</p>

                <h2>Nurse</h2>
                <p>We started with making a young nurse who is very overworked, but also wants to improve the work pressure. With the user journey we wanted her to get the knowledge of the application through asking a work colleague about how they deal with the work pressure. She then goes to the website, makes an account and starts using the application. She likes that she can talk with her manager in the application and also recoomends it to others. </p>

              <h2>Neurologist</h2>
              <p>We then made a neurologist who is very into innovation and improving work. With the user journey he got to know the application through a convention, he then starts using it and it gives him new ideas about how to improve his work. He also likes that he can call a number to talk with support about the application. He then discusses it with his department head about implementing it for the whole department. </p>

            <h2>Child doctor</h2>
            <p>After the nurse and neurologist we wanted to make a negative person who still likes the application. We did this by making a child doctor who wants to make their work easier, so that they have a more relaxed working environment. She got to know the application through seeing a poster about it and then scanning the QR code on it. She then starts using it and likes that she can ask questions in the live chat instead of having to find the people who she normally asks quesitons to. She also recommends it to her colleagues so that their work also gets easier. </p>

          <h2>General Practitioner</h2>
          <p>After the nurse, neurologist and child doctor we wanted to make a negative experience with the application. We mostly wanted to do this so that we know how a negative experience might be and how we can avoid this. We did this by making a gp who really dislikes electronics. He got to know about the application through hearing about it from his colleagues. He then starts using the website, but he doesn't understand and he doens't get any support in the application and he immediately removes the application and disadvices all who will listen about the application.  </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>with these personas and user journey we tried to take into account how healthcare workers might be and how they might react to the application. We now have an idea of how they might react to it and how to anticipate on potential negative responce to the application.  </p>
