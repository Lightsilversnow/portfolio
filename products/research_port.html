                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>For the research question what should always be easy to find, no matter which page you’re on on the
                    website, the navigation bar should show when you scroll up. The navbar should include a link to the
                    home page, your projects and what’s important for your website, for instance the learning outcomes.
                    <br><br>
                    For the research question how can I make the portfolio easy and intuitive to navigate it’s important to
                    not divert too much from existing examples. This makes it easier for people to find everything on the
                    page and makes it less frustrating to use. The homepage should be a brief overview of the project
                    highlights. The project page should show the projects with mostly images and a very brief
                    description. The projects themselves should show the project and use images as much as possible
                    instead of describing the project.</p>
