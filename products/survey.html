                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>For the development of our mobile application, Tessa and Robin needed more information on
                    SurveyJS: a library that makes it possible to create surveys. The SurveyJS library is already being used
                    by the development team of the Samen aan Z project, and by using the same library we can make
                    the integration of our app with their app easier. At the same time, we can make this a test to see
                    how well the SurveyJS library works on mobile, as that hasn't been tested yet by the main
                    development team.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>After researching and working with SurveyJS, we now understand how it works and how we can
                    implement it in our mobile (and desktop) application. We know how to build a survey, the different
                    settings we can adjust, and the different designs we can use for the Likert scale. We also have
                    implemented these surveys in our prototype so that we can test them with users. We will inform the
                    main development team about the bug that exists in viewing the smileys and the numbers on mobile
                    and will make this a point in our advice document.</p>
