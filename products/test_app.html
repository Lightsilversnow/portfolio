                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Most test users liked how the app looked, and how easy it was to use. The app seems also be clear
                    to people that don't have much knowledge on technology, although this should be tested more to
                    be sure. The rewards system, while fun, wasn't received well by the test users. They don't think it
                    add much to the application, and they said that they wouldn't use it themselves. One person said
                    they may use the feature more if it's more connected with healthcare, and it can give fun facts about
                    healthcare topics. The smileys were received well by all test users, and the feature where the app
                    shows how the results have been implemented is a very important because it shows the usefulness
                    of the surveys. This motivates the users to fill in the surveys. Notifications should also be added in a
                    next iteration to promote further filling out of the surveys.</p>
