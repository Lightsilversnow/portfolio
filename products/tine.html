                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The first trials of the surveys weren't very successful. Users did fill in the first few surveys, but
                    stopped filling them in at some point, giving the researchers too little information for them to create
                    any meaningful conclusions and results. Because of this, Tine would like us to focus on how to
                    engage users more, so that the data gets filled in more often and by more people. To do this, we are
                    allowed to make some changes, as long as we donâ€™t change the questions or the order of the
                    questions within a question block. We are allowed to combine the half-year surveys with the weekly
                    surveys so as not to have a really big survey every half a year, which could discourage users from
                    finishing the survey. This expert interview gave us more freedom to work on different solutions,
                    which was discouraged originally by other members of the project.
                    <br><br>
                    The goal of the project became much clearer to us after this interview. We now have an idea of what
                    has been achieved previously and how the project would like to move forward and focus on.
                    Additionally, we now understand what our role is in the project and what is expected of us. We have
                    much more freedom than originally thought, and this creates new opportunities to find and develop
                    ways to engage users. Now that we have access to the survey and we have our questions answered,
                    we finally have a clear idea of what this project is about and how we can move forward</p>
